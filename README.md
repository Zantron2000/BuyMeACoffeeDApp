This is a basic DApp using hardhat and next.js

It is an application that is used to deploy an address with a contract
to collect tips from users, and a front end server that allows users to interact,
and send money to owners. The backend also contains one more script that allows the owner
to withdraw the money back to themselves.

Execute any of the backend commands by running npx hardhat run -script- on any of the backend scripts
Turn on the server by entering npm run dev inside the frontend folder
